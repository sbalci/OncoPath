Description: OncoPath Functions for Clinicopathological Research.
        Specialized oncology and pathology visualization tools from
        ClinicoPath jamovi module. OncoPath helps researchers create
        comprehensive patient follow-up plots including waterfall plots
        for treatment response analysis and swimmer plots for patient
        timeline visualization. Features RECIST criteria analysis,
        ggswim integration, comprehensive clinical event tracking,
        diagnostic test meta-analysis with bivariate modeling and HSROC
        methods, and IHC heterogeneity analysis for pathology biomarker
        studies.
