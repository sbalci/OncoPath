  OncoPath Functions for Clinicopathological Research. Specialized oncology and
  pathology visualization tools from ClinicoPath jamovi module. OncoPath helps
  researchers create comprehensive patient follow-up plots including waterfall
  plots for treatment response analysis and swimmer plots for patient timeline
  visualization.

    description: >
      Creates waterfall and spider plots to analyze tumor response data
      following RECIST criteria. Supports both raw tumor measurements and
      pre-calculated percentage changes. Provides comprehensive response
      analysis including ORR, DCR, and person-time metrics.

    menuTitle: Advanced TNM Stage Migration Analysis
    menuSubtitle: State-of-the-Art Staging System Validation
    description: >-
      Comprehensive analysis for validating TNM staging system improvements
      using state-of-the-art  statistical methods. This analysis provides
      pathologists with robust tools to evaluate whether  a new staging system
      provides superior prognostic discrimination compared to existing systems.

      Includes advanced metrics: Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI),
      Integrated Discrimination  Improvement (IDI), time-dependent ROC analysis,
      decision curve analysis, bootstrap validation,  and comprehensive clinical
      interpretation guidance.

      Comprehensive meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies designed
      for 

      pathology research. Performs bivariate random-effects modeling, HSROC
      analysis, 

      meta-regression, and publication bias assessment for AI algorithm
      validation 

      and biomarker diagnostic accuracy synthesis.
