  OncoPath Functions for Clinicopathological Research. Specialized oncology and
  pathology visualization tools from ClinicoPath jamovi module. OncoPath helps
  researchers create comprehensive patient follow-up plots including waterfall
  plots for treatment response analysis and swimmer plots for patient timeline
  visualization.

    description: >
      Creates waterfall and spider plots to analyze tumor response data
      following RECIST criteria. Supports both raw tumor measurements and
      pre-calculated percentage changes. Provides comprehensive response
      analysis including ORR, DCR, and person-time metrics.
